# AVSS

This is the repository for the Airbonrne Virus Sanitation System application created for ECE4655  (Digital Image Processing). It contains Python Code and will eventually contain the object classifier model which the Google TensorFlow machine learning framework will utilize to send signals to the GPIO of our NVIDIA Jetson Nano Microprocessor.

## Functionality and Usage
Functionality for this project and installation instructions will be located in this section of the README when complete.

```python
# Insert the most relevant code here.
```

Another section of important functionality and explaination will be located below.

```python
# Second most relevant coding section here, and so on.
```

The program is currently under construction. However, upon completion it should using a `machine learning framework` to interface with a `NVIDIA Jetson Nano Microprocessor` in order run `convolutional neural networks` on video footage (~20fps). Eventually the goal is the prompt an alarm and a linear actuator as part of a `real time embedded system`. The system will sanitize a given region with a disinfectant of some sort.
