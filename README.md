The program is currently under construction. However, upon completion it should using a `machine learning framework` to interface with a `NVIDIA Jetson Nano Microprocessor` in order run `convolutional neural networks` on video footage (~20fps). Eventually the goal is the prompt an alarm and a linear actuator as part of a `real time embedded system`. The system will sanitize a given region with a disinfectant of some sort.
